# Project Title: Covid + Climate

# COVID-19 Wastewater and Case Data Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between Covid-19 cases and wastewater antigens across various counties and States in the United States. Using data from wastewater testing and reported COVID-19 cases, we are taregting to provide awareness into the trends as wells as correlations make the helthcare industry better.
 By using the pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and scipy.stats libraries, the script reveals several key calculations on two datasets: one containing wastewater data and the other with COVID-19 case statistics.

## Introduction

The spread of COVID-19 has prompted innovative approaches to monitor the virus's prevalence in communities. Wastewater analysis serves as a valuable tool for public health officials, providing an early warning system for outbreaks. This analysis combines wastewater antigen data with reported COVID-19 case numbers to explore their relationship over time.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`

You can install the required packages using pip:

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-climate-analysis.git
    cd covid-climate-analysis
    ```

2. **Place the CSV files** (`wastewater_by_county.csv` and `cases_by_county.csv`) in the `resources` directory.

3. **Run the analysis script**:
    ```bash
    python analysis.py
    ```

4. **View the generated visualizations** that illustrate trends and correlations.

## Data Sources

- Wastewater data sourced from local public health departments.
- COVID-19 case data obtained from state health departments and relevant health organizations.

## Analysis

The analysis is performed in several key steps:

1. **Data Import**: The script reads the CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Dates are formatted appropriately, and columns are renamed for clarity.
3. **Data Merging**: Wastewater and case data are combined into a single DataFrame for comparative analysis.
4. **Visualization**: Various plots are generated to illustrate trends over time and regional differences.

### Key Metrics Analyzed

- **Antigens in Wastewater**: Concentration of virus particles found in wastewater samples.
- **COVID-19 Cases**: Rolling average cases per 100,000 residents.

## Results

The analysis produces several visualizations, including:

- **Bar plots** comparing total antigens in wastewater with rolling average COVID-19 case numbers by state.
- **Line plots** displaying trends over time for both metrics.
